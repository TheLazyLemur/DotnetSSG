# Dotnet SSG

## About

A static site generator(SSG) written in Dotnet Core and C#.
Its probably not good enough to use, and I have actually not built anything with it yet, however I will keep developing for as long as im not bored, I will build my personal Site with this.

## Roadmap

- Add list page layout.
- Add custom data type access(should be accessible globally like in Hugo).
- Create CLI for genertaing classes and templates.
- Make use of a config file instead of hard coding directory variables.
- Netlify integration.
- Generate sitemap.xml
- Genrate index.xml
- Add static folder directory
